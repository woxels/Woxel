summary: Open Source 3D voxel editor that's better than Goxel ;p
description: |
  Woxel uses intuitive controls identical to Minetest or Minecraft, while providing a design experience similar to Goxel or Magicalvoxel.

  Mouse locks when you click on the game window, press ESCAPE or TAB to unlock the mouse.

  * W,A,S,D = Move around based on relative orientation to X and Y.
  * SPACE + L-SHIFT = Move up and down relative Z.
  * F = Toggle player fast speed on and off.
  * 1-7 = Change move speed for selected fast state.
  * P = Toggle pitch lock.

  * Left Click / R-SHIFT = Place node.
  * Right Click / R-CTRL = Delete node.
  * Q / Z / Middle Click / Mouse4 = Clone color of pointed node.
  * E / Mouse5 = Replace color of pointed node.
  * R = Toggle mirror brush.
  * V = Places voxel at current position
  * X + C / Slash + Quote = Change texture of pointed node.

  * F1 = Resets environment state back to default.
  * F2 = Toggle HUD visibility.
  * F3 = Save. *(auto saves on exit or idle for more than 3 minutes)*
  * F8 = Load. *(will erase what you have done since the last save)*

  Your state is automatically saved on exit.

  Check the console output for more information, arguments can be passed to the program to export your project, create a new project, load a project from file, change mouse sensitivity and apply custom color palettes to projects.
